# ChessCheater

Fun project idea, create a python programme to "cheat" at chess, inspired by Hans Niemann. 
Use PyAutoGUI to screenshot the screen.
Bit of machine learning to identify the chessboard and the pieces, and figure out where the pieces are located.
Research if there's a chess engine for Python, pretty sure there is...
More PyAutoGUI to help click the piece and move it to where it needs to go. Let's see how it all goes, very excited.

Disclaimer: I do not condone cheating and I don't plan on using this to gain an edge over other players. 
I just want to play around with the idea on how easy it would be to cheat at chess online.
My Chess.com profile is Bruce_Max_Dickie, I've been a low rated player for years and I do not think that will change anytime soon.
If that does change, be sus of me.
